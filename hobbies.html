    <h4>
      <ol>
        <li>Knitting</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Knitting is a lot like coding. A complex code tells me what to do with the yarn and needles, and each line affects the lines before and after it in order to make a complete item.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Linguistics</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Linguistics is the study of how we communicate. Learning to code is learning how to communicate with computers, and using them to communicate with other humans or robots.</li>
          </ul>
        <li>Biking</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Storytime: I went on a horrible biking trip once and swore I would never ride a bike again. But soon after, I decided to get really into biking. Purely out of spite. In the same way, after a horrible coding class, I swore off learning to program, but now I'm so fuelled by spite that I will become a programmer.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Reading</li>
        <ul>
          <li>My favorite childhood genre was historical fiction, and this has evolved into a love of history, politics, and culture.</li>
        </ul>
